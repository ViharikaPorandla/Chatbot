def advanced_chatbot():
    print("Hello! I'm an advanced chatbot using NLTK. How can I assist you today?")

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ").lower()
        tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)

        if any(greet in tokens for greet in ["hi", "hello", "hey"]):
            print("Bot: Hello! How can I help you today?")

        elif any(phrase in user_input for phrase in ["how are you", "how's it going", "how are you doing"]):
            print("Bot: I'm just a bot, but I'm here to help you!")

        elif "weather" in tokens:
            print("Bot: I can't check the weather right now, but you can check a weather website for that information.")

        elif "time" in tokens:
            print("Bot: I don't have a clock, but you can check the time on your device.")

        elif "name" in tokens:
            print("Bot: I'm just a simple chatbot with no name.")

        elif "joke" in tokens:
            jokes = [
                "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
                "Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!",
                "Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs."
            ]
            print(f"Bot: {random.choice(jokes)}")

        elif "bye" in tokens or "exit" in tokens:
            print("Bot: Goodbye! Have a great day!")
            break

        else:
